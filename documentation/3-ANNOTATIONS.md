# Annotations
This page is meant to help you get an idea of the available Elepy annotations.
There are four types of annotations. RestModel annotations, Field annotations, Dependency Injection annotations and Routing annotations.

## RestModel Annotations
These are the most important annotations. They help you configure how a RestModel works.
## Field Annotations
You use these annotations to annotate your fields. They are mostly used to keep data integrity. They can also be used to visually change how a field is displayed in the CMS.
## Dependency Injection Annotations
These annotations help you integrate Elepy's moving parts. Almost all dynamically loaded classes can be injected with your application's context.
## Routing Annotations
These annotations help you define extra functionality through routes.
